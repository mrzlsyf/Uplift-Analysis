# 📈 Uplift Analysis 🎯

## 🚀 Overview
A data-driven project focused on evaluating the effectiveness of a **new advertising strategy** through **A/B testing**. By analyzing the differences between a **control group** and a **exposed group**, we assess the impact of ads on user engagement and conversions. The ultimate goal is to identify the most effective strategy for improving customer responses and return on investment (ROI).
